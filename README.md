# Leadership Event

## Landing page build using Bootstrap 5 and SCSS.

This is the landing page cloned from the [TemplateMo](https://templatemo.com/live/templatemo_575_leadership_event). In this , I have used 7-1 pattern for managable code base.  You can learn more about it from [7-1 pattern](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5625786-produce-maintainable-css-with-sass/5723581-use-the-7-1-pattern-for-a-manageable-codebase). And as for the naming convention, I have been using BEM(Block Element Modifier). Here is a blog post where you might have an idea how to use them with scss [BEM](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/bem-and-sass-whats-the-difference-and-how-to-use-them/)
