# Leadership Event

## Landing page build using Bootstrap 5 and SCSS

This landing page is a clone of the TemplateMo design for a [Leadership Event](https://templatemo.com/live/templatemo_575_leadership_event). It has been built using `Bootstrap 5` and `SCSS`, following the `7-1 pattern` for a manageable code base. If you're not familiar with the 7-1 pattern, you can learn more about it on [OpenClassromBLog](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5625786-produce-maintainable-css-with-sass/5723581-use-the-7-1-pattern-for-a-manageable-codebase).

In terms of naming convention, I've used the `BEM (Block Element Modifier)` approach. For those who aren't familiar with it, you can read a helpful blog post about using BEM and SCSS on [PullrequestBlog](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/bem-and-sass-whats-the-difference-and-how-to-use-them/).
